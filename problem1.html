       <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>
        Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup.
        All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML.
        CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.

            CSS frameworks include Foundation, Blueprint, Bootstrap, Cascade Framework and Materialize.
            Like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML .
